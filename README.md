# CISC480_SignatureWorkPortfolio

This repository contains information, links, and files associated with various projects that I have worked on during my time at the University of St. Thomas as a Computer and Information Science (CISC) student. The links and files in this repository demonstrate the learning that I was fortunate to be able to do at UST, as well as the variety of topics which were able to be explored in a manner which emphasized the most important CISC concepts as well as the values integral to the common good which is the cornerstone of a UST education.

The first link is to a separate GitHub repository which contains HTML, CSS and JavaScript files which were used to build a website for UST’s Web Development course (CISC 375). Right below that link is a link to a 5-minute YouTube video which walks through that project and demonstrates some of the basic concepts of web development which were used in the creation of that project.

The next three links are to a website called “shadertoy.com”, which is used for creating and sharing shaders through WebGL. There are three different shaders which I have created, mostly by following online tutorials as a starting point and then experimenting by trying out new features of GLSL. The links are specifically to a neon colored continuously morphing pattern shader, a repeating fractal shader, and a shader of a white orb revolving in 3 dimensions.

Following these projects are descriptions of coursework and the accompanying files. There are files for UST’s Computational Statistics and Data Analysis (STAT360). Of these, there are 4 HTML homework files which were produced by knitting an RMD file in RStudio based on Professor Berg’s Textbook and Homework Questions. Additionally, there is a PowerPoint file which was used for a presentation on a statistical analysis of crime in St. Paul. This PowerPoint file is the culmination of a semester long project which used covariance-based data analysis and structural equation modeling to detect patterns within environmental and geographical data related to crime reports in St. Paul. 

Following the STAT360 coursework, there is coursework from UST’s Database Design course (CISC450). Those PDF files were produced using Overleaf.com, a site used to produce PDFs via LaTeX. I first used Overleaf.com and LaTeX in UST’s Algorithms course (CISC380), but continued to use those resources for later courses because of the functionality and customization available using those tools. I found LaTeX to be a very useful skill despite the somewhat steep learning curve. The HW pdfs demonstrate those LaTeX skills as well as responses to prompts from the “Database System Concepts” text used as a foundation for that course. 

Following those HW files, there is coursework from UST’s Legacy Language course (CISC487). Those files are named “CISC487_HW1_Grade_Book_Screenshot.png” and “Second COBOL Programming Assignment.pdf” and demonstrate some of the COBOL code and Command Prompt outputs which made up the assignments for that course. COBOL is one of the oldest high level language that is still in use for large-scale transaction processing done by large financial institutions. Learning about COBOL, as well as Fortran, gave me an interesting insight into the history of computing.

Finally, there is a UML diagram titled “RCDS_Login_Authentication_Sequence_Diagram_Marcus_Haldane_CORRECTED.png” which was used for familiarizing students like myself with the tools which would later be used in UST’s Senior Capstone course (CISC480). This UML diagram was built on websequencediagrams.com, and gave me a great tool which can be used to keep track of function calls and procedures in complex codebases like the RCDS codebase that was the focus of this Senior Capstone course.
